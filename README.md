## Recommendations ##
If you want to have a good experience with the app usage I recommend install *[UScreenCapture](https://www.videohelp.com/software/UScreenCapture)* and *[ffdshow video encoder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow-tryout/)*.
* The **UScreenCapture** apply you to capture windows os's screen and change some settings of capture process.
* The **ffdshow video encoder** uses more effective method of video compression, then the result video uses a little space on disk.
